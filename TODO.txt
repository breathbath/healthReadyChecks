- Make kafka sidecar options compatible with generic consumer/reuse consumer options instead of repeating them
- Move integration tests to corresponding modules
- Sync calls failure handling The current agreed strategy is:
                              for async inputs from Kafka we let it repeat and fail after configurable amount of repetitions which should be reported as an alarm
                              for sync inputs we report failures to the sync caller if the other side is not available so we let the caller repeat the action if needed (include POD LM)
                              This should be implemented and tested for all so far implemented endpoints
- Check if the payload deserialization logic of inputs is outside of the executors
- Check transactions on etcd v3 API for atomic key storage
- Check if etcd leaves namespaces/keys after testing
- Merge kafka and sidecar logic into a single module
